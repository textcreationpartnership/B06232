            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The true Engliſh Proteſtant Souldiers Reſolution.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is not alone the many Declarations and Votes of Parliament, that reveale unto us how ſtrong an influence the Papiſts have over the King, and his Dominions: Nor all the Remonſtrances con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Ireland</hi> ſo clearly evincing by what means that barbarous and horrid Rebellion was firſt fomented, and hath been ſince continued: Nor the Kings own Letters to the Queene ſo wholly depending upon her Counſells, conveyed from <hi>Rome</hi> and Jeſuits: (All which have been publiſht to forewarne us of our dangers.) But it is more then manifeſt alſo, By the Popes Letter to the King, and the Kings to the Pope, long ſince made known to the world in <hi>French,</hi> and now tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated, acted, and almoſt fulfilled in <hi>Engliſh.</hi> By all the paſſages and proceedings of both the Matches when a Proteſtant Lady was propounded and neglected: By the Jeſuits arguing for the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Match: By the increaſe, domineerings, threatnings, and preferments for many yeares of Papiſts, By Intelligence from all the parts of Chriſtendome: By Sir <hi>Tobie Mathews;</hi> The three Nuncioes; The Queene Mothers, with all her Jeſuits gracious entertainment: By an whole Colledge of Capuchins: By the exceeding great decay of our auncient Proteſtant Nobilitie; and the diſcouraging, neglecting, and affronting ſuch as remained: By forcing Idolatry and Popiſh Ceremonies upon the Conſcience: By long pleading for ſix Prieſts and Jeſuits, contrary to Law and promiſe after two others pardoned, which ended in the accuſation of as many Members of Parliament: By making havocke of Proteſtants, to ſet up Proteſtant Religion: By arming of Papiſts, to beate downe Popery; And by thouſands of Arguments and Obſervations more, <hi>That we are abſolutely ſold to Rome and her Adherents:</hi> The <hi>Achme</hi> of whoſe Antichriſtian Devotion is, not onely to aſſault the liberties and rob the treaſures, but confound, deſtroy, maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre, and roote out all People and Nations that make not haſte with them to the ſame degree of damnation: To prevent which over-ſpreading miſchiefe, we (as all true Proteſtants of the Kingdome have done) have taken up defenſive Arms againſt theſe bloudy enemies of nature, goodneſſe, and Religion, wherein ſince there have been already waſted much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and true-hearted bloud of many thouſands of our deare kindred, friends, and allies, and many millions of our free and liberall loanes and Contributions expended towards the ſame; There is now no likely way left to ſave us from being no more a Nation nor a People (much leſſe to have our Religion) by all the attempts ſo aymed at, but for the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (at leaſt ſo many as have any ſenſe of pietie, honour, or compaſſion towards their brethren, and do truly weigh and underſtand their Oaths of Allegeance, Supremacy, Proteſtation, and late Covenant) to unite as one man: And according to the Orders and Declarations of Parliament; eſpecially of the 26<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Ianuary</hi> laſt, to come to ayde that high Aſſembly, and in them our ſelves, whoſe eternall Trophie it will be, (though their lives and States ſuffer by it,) to dye in reforming <hi>England,</hi> and in the ſtrength of Chriſt, to oppoſe the Gates of Hell, and powers of Darkneſſe, with their ſworne factors the Prieſts and Jeſuits. For theſe are they that have at once attempted, and in great meaſure acted the Maſſacres of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> as they have formerly done in the <hi>Low Countries, France,</hi> and <hi>Germany.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are they who though diſcovered, dare yet continue to plot miſchiefe, and perſwade the King to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim and juſtifie himſelfe the authour of thoſe plots againſt his own naturall ſubjects.</p>
            <p>Theſe are they who yet in deſpite of the Acts and Orders of Parliament, dare walke our ſtreets, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front authority.</p>
            <p>Theſe are they whoſe Ieſuiticall incantations firſt wrought jealouſies, and afterwards by the bare names of Browniſts, Anabaptiſts Separatiſts, and Round-heads; conjured up moſt ſtrong diviſions into the members of the ſame Body, and by them through the whole Kingdome. For it is their Character to ſeduce (if it were poſſible) the very elect, and as the taile of the Dragon in theſe laſt times, to ſweep down the ſtarres of heaven.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the Locuſts of that <hi>Apollion Abaddon,</hi> That deſtroy both reaſon and conſcience, ſoule and body, liberty, and eſtate, That deſtroy the King, That deſtroy the Parliament, That deſtroy the Kingdome, That deſtroy all holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. This is Antichriſt, <hi>The Antichriſt,</hi> even Babylon the great. So that the contemplation, of this is enough to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame the frozen ſpirits of the dead, and raiſe them up to battell. Here is a Cauſe, here, here is an Alarm to call forth <hi>Michael</hi> and his Angels, and the glorious Hoaſt of Heaven to warre. Wherefore forſaking all by reſpects and nick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>names invented to divide us, and looking up to the Almighty power which is to be ſeen in the Mount, beleeving theſe extremities ordered by his all-wiſe providence to neceſſitate us to the performance of his will, againſt that mother of Harlots and abhominations of the Earth.</p>
            <p>We doe in the voyce of the Angell earneſtly intreat all Proteſtant Chriſtians to come out of Babylon, and forſake thoſe Antichriſtian Papiſts, and not to plead for them, nor joyn with them, leſt they be partakers of their puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And we doe for our parts all ſolemnly proteſt in obedience to the ſaid declaration of Parliament, of <hi>Ian.</hi> 26. laſt, that ſince there is no other means left (as we conceive) of aſſiſting that honourable Aſſembly, or of enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing peace, or the Goſpell of peace, nor ſo much as our owne Lives, where theſe Antichriſtian Locuſts have any footing, Wee will endevour the baniſhment or utter extirpation of all Papiſts out of this Kingdome, as the authors and incendiaries of theſe unnaturall and bloody warres; and bring to condigne puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, all ſuch as contrary to their oathes of Supremacie, Allegeance, Proteſtation and Covenant, ſhall oppoſe themſelves to hinder the juſt and neceſſary performance of this our reſolution.</p>
